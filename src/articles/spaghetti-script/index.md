# SpaghettiScript: The Programming Language Where You Only Write Spaghetti Code

![HEADER|SpaghettiScript Interpreter Screenshot](images/header.webp)

In May of 2020, stuck inside from the pandemic, I discovered the [esolangs.org](https://esolangs.org) wiki. I quickly found out about the underground world of **esoteric programming languages**, and I instantly fell in love.

I particularly took a liking to [BrainF---](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck), in which the hello world code looks like this:

```
++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---
.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.
```

As you can tell, this is no ordinary programming language.
